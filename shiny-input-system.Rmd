# Shiny's input system {#shiny-input-system}
Shiny inputs are key elements of Shiny apps since they are a way for the end-user to interact with the app. You may know `sliderInput`, `numericInput`, `checkboxInput` but sometimes you may need fancier elements like `knobInput` from [shinyWidgets](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets/blob/master/R/input-knob.R), as depicted on Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-inputs) or even more sophisticated inputs like the `smartSelect` of [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile/blob/master/R/f7-inputs.R) (Figure \@ref(fig:fancy-inputs), right panel). Have you ever wondered what are the mechanisms behind inputs? Have you ever dreamt to develop your own?

The goal of this section is to understand how Shiny inputs work.

```{r fancy-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.show = "hold", out.width = "50%", fig.align = "default", fig.cap='Custom shiny inputs. left: knobInput from shinyWidgets; right: smart select from shinyMobile'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/jquery-knobs.png")
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/smart-select.png")
```

## Initialization
When we run our app, most of the time it works just fine! The question is, how are the inputs and outputs handeled correctly to allow this to happen? Upon initialization, Shiny runs several JavaScript functions. Not surprisingly, there is one called [`init_shiny`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/init_shiny.js) containing a subtantial number of elements such as `bindInputs` and `unbindInputs` to bind/unbind inputs. Besides, they are accessible to the programmer (see a usecase [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51633326/dateinput-not-working-on-dt-in-shiny)). To illustrate what they do, let's run the app below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
              min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

We then open the HTML inspector and run `Shiny.unbindAll(document)` (document is the scope, that is where to search). Try to change the slider input. You will notice that nothing happens. Now let's type `Shiny.bindAll(document)` and update the slider value. Moving the slider successfuly update the plot. Magic isn't it? This simply shows that when inputs are not bound, nothing happens so binding inputs is necessary. 

Let's see below what is an input binding and how it works.

## Input bindings

### Input structure
An input element is given by the `<input>` tag as well as several attributes.

```html
<input id = inputId type = "text" class = "input-text" value = value>
```

  - id garantees the input uniquess. We will see very soon that all instances of the same input share a unique input binding, therefore id is mandatory.
  - [type](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type.asp) 
  - class is targeted by CSS and JavaScript
  - value holds the input value

### Binding Shiny inputs
An input binding allows Shiny to identify each instance of a given input and what you may do with this input. For instance, a slider input must update whenever the range is dragged or when the left and right arrows of the keyboard are pressed. It relies on a class defined in the `input_binding.js` [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/input_binding.js). 

Let's describe each method chronologically. For better convenience, the book side package contains step by step demonstrations which may be found [here](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/outstanding-shiny-ui-code/blob/master/R/inputs.R). Each example is called by the `customTextInputExample`, which takes the input binding step as only parameter. For instance `customTextInputExample(1)` will invoke the first step.

#### Find the input
The first step, is critical which is to locate the input in the DOM. On the R side, we define an input, with a specific attribute that will serve as a receptor for the binding. For most of inputs, this may be handled by the type attribute. In other cases, this may be the class, like for the `actionButton`. On the JS side, we need a method that will identify this receptor. Moreover, two different types of inputs (for instance `radioButton` and `selectInput`) cannot have the same receptor for conflict reasons, whereas two instances of the same input type can (if your app contains 10 sliders, they all share the same input binding!). The receptor identifier is provided by the `find` method of the `InputBinding` class. This method must be applied on a scope, that is the `document`.  `find` accepts any valid jQuery selector. Note the `console.log` only here for debugging purpose.

```javascript
find: function(scope) {
  console.log($(scope).find('.input-text'));
  return $(scope).find('.input-text');
}
```

Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-find-inputs) summarizes this important step.

```{r shiny-find-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='How to find inputs?'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-find-inputs.png")
```

Below, we are going to create a new binding for the `textInput`, with only two methods mentioned in the previous section, that is `find` and `getValue`. For that, we need to create a customized text input, `customTextInput` to make it unique. We now add the `input-text` class and make our own input binding pointing to that specific class.

```{r}
customTextInput <- function (inputId, label, value = "", width = NULL, placeholder = NULL) {
  
  # this external wrapper ensure to control the input width
  div(
    class = "form-group shiny-input-container", 
    style = if (!is.null(width)) {
      paste0("width: ", validateCssUnit(width), ";")
    },
    # input label
    shinyInputLabel(inputId, label), 
    
    # input element + JS dependencies
    tagList(
      customTextInputDeps(),
      tags$input(
        id = inputId,
        type = "text",
        class = "form-control input-text",
        value = value,
        placeholder = placeholder
      )
    )
  )
}
```

The last part of the code contains a `tagList` with two elements:

  - The element input binding
  - The input tag
  
Below is an example of how we managed the dependency creation in our side package.
Considering multiple inputs, we will add more script to the dependency by passing a vector to the script parameter. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputDeps <- function() {
  htmlDependency(
    name = "customTextBindings",
    version = "1.0.0",
    src = c(file = system.file("chapter5/input-bindings", package = "OSUICode")),
    script = "customTextInputBinding.js"
  )
}
```

In the [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile/tree/master/inst/framework7-5.5.0) package, we chose a more robust approach. All bindings are contained in a folder and compressed so that we generate only one minified file containing all collapsed bindings. 

Figure \@ref(fig:text-input) shows the main elements of the `textInput` widget. In the above code, `shinyInputLabel` is a Shiny internal function that creates the numeric input label, or in other word the text displayed next to it. The core input element is wrapped by `tags$input`. No worry if the structure seems unclear, we will give more details about shiny tags in the Chapter \@ref(htmltools-overview).

```{r text-input, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny\'s textInput elements'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/text-input.png")
```


We invite the reader to run the first example below and open the HTML inspector and look at the `console.log` result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample(1)
```

Results are shown on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-find-inputs-result). If the corresponding input is found, you should see the corresponding tag element in the HTML inspector console.

```{r shiny-find-inputs-result, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='find method output'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-find-inputs-result.png")
```

#### Initialize inputs
Upon initialization, Shiny calls the `initializeInputs` function that takes all input bindings and call their `initialize` method before binding all inputs. Note that once an input has been initialized it has a `_shiny_initialized` tag to avoid initializing it twice. The initialize method is not always defined but some elements require to be explicitly initialized or activated. For instance the  [Framework7](https://framework7.io) API, on top of which [shinyMobile](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinyMobile) is built, require to instantiate all elements. Below is an example for the [toggle](https://framework7.io/docs/toggle.html) input:

```javascript
// what is expected
let toggle = app.toggle.create({
  el: '.toggle',
  on: {
    change: function () {
      console.log('Toggle changed')
    }
  }
});
```

`el: '.toggle'` means that we are looking at the element(s) having the `toggle` class. `app.toggle.create` is internal to the Framework7 API. The corresponding shinyMobile input binding starts as follows. 

```javascript
var f7ToggleBinding = new Shiny.InputBinding();
  $.extend(f7ToggleBinding, {
    initialize: function(el) {
      app.toggle.create({el: el});
    },
    // other methods
});
```

Once initialized, we may use all specific methods provided by the API. [Framework7](https://framework7.io) is clearly a gold mine, as its API provides many possible options for many inputs / widgets. Later in this section, we will demonstrate how to initialize a box element from the [AdminLTE2](https://adminlte.io/docs/2.4/js-box-widget) HTML template.

#### Get the value
`getValue(el)` returns the input value. The way to obtain the value is different for almost all inputs. For instance, the `textInput` is pretty simple since the value is located in the `value` attribute. `el` refers to the element holding the id attribute and recognized by the `find` method. Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-el) shows the result of a `console.log($(el));`.

```{r shiny-el, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='About el'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-el.png")
```

```javascript
getValue: function(el) {
  console.log($(el));
  return $(el).val();
}
```

To get the value, we apply the jQuery method `val` on the `$(el)` element and return the result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample(2)
```

This time, the input value is returned. Notice that when you try to change the text content, the output value does not update as we would normally expect. We are actually missing a couple of methods so that the binding is fully working. We will introduce them in the following sections!

#### Set and update 
`setValue(el, value)` is used to set the value of the current input. This method is necessary so that the input value may be updated. It has to be used in combination with `receiveMessage(el, data)`, which is the JavaScript part of all the R `updateInput` functions. We usually call the `setValue` method inside.

```javascript
setValue: function(el, value) {
  $(el).val(value);
}
```

Let's create a function to update our custom text input. Call it `updateCustomTextInput`. It requires at least 3 parameters:

- inputId tells which input to update.
- value is the new value. This will be taken by the `setValue ` JS method in the input binding
- session is the Shiny session object mentioned earlier. We will use the `sendInputMessage` to send values from R to JavaScript. The `receiveMessage` method will apply `setValue` with the data received from R.

```{r}
updateCustomTextInput <- function(inputId, value = NULL, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message = value)
}
```

We add `setValue` and `receiveMessage` to custom input binding.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(3)
```

Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-update-inputs) illustrates the main mechanisms.

```{r shiny-update-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Events following a click on the update button. This figure demonstrates how R and JS communicate, through the websocket.'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-update-inputs.png")
```


If we have to pass multiple elements to update, we would have to change the `updateCustomTextInput` function such as:

```{r}
updateCustomTextInput <- function(inputId, value = NULL, placeholder = NULL, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  message <- dropNulls(
    list(
      value = value,
      placeholder = placeholder
    )
  )
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message)
}
```

`dropNulls` is an internal function ensuring that the list does not contain NULL elements. We send a list from R, which is then serialized to a JSON object. In the `receiveMessage` method, properties like `value` may be accessed using the . notation:

```javascript
receiveMessage: function(el, data) {
  console.log(data);
  if (data.hasOwnProperty('value')) {
    this.setValue(el, data.value);
  }
  // other parameters to update...
}
```

So far so good! We managed to update the text input value. Yet, after clicking the button, the output value does not change. We are going to fix this missing step in the next section.

#### Subscribe
`subscribe(el, callback)` listens to events defining Shiny to update the input value and make it available in the app. Some API like Bootstrap explicitly mention those events (like `hide.bs.tab`, `shown.bs.tab`, ...).
Going back to our custom text input, what event would make it change?

- After a key is release on the keyboard. We may listen to `keyup`
- After copying and pasting any text in the input field or dictating text. The `input` event may be helpful

We may add those [events](https://javascript.info/events-change-input) to our binding using an event listener seen at the end of Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript).

```javascript
$(el).on('keyup.customTextBinding input.customTextBinding', function(event) {
  callback(true);
});
```

`callback` ensures that the new value is captured by Shiny. We will come back later on the callback parameter.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(4)
```

Hooray! The output result is successfully changed when the input value is manually updated. However, nothing happens when we click on the update button. What did we miss? Looking back at the `receiveMessage` method, we changed the input value but how does Shiny knows that this step was successful? To check that no event is raised, we put a `console.log(event);` in the `subscribe` method. Any action like removing the text content or adding new text triggers event but clicking on the action button does not. Therefore, we must trigger an event and add it to the `subscribe` method. We may choose the `change` event, that triggers when an element is updated.

```javascript
$(el).on('change.customTextBinding', function(event) {
  callback(false);
});
```

Let's try again.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateCustomTextInputExample(5)
```

Perfect? Not exactly. 

#### Setting rate policies
It would be better to only change the input value once the keyboard is completely released for some time (and not each time a key is released). This is what we call debouncing, which allows a delay before telling Shiny to read the new value, and is achieved using the `getRatePolicy` method. Additionally, we must also pass `true` to the `callback` in the subscribe method, in order to apply our specific rate policy ([debounce](https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-debounce-function), throttle). This is useful for instance when we don't want to flood the server with useless update requests. For example when using a slider, we only want to send the value as soon as the range stops moving and not all intermediate values. Those elements are defined [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/input_rate.js).


Run the app below and try to manually change the text input value by adding a couple of letters as fast as you can. What do you notice? We see the output value only updates when we release the keyboard.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
customTextInputExample(6)
```

You may adjust the delay according to your needs, but we caution to not set the delay too long as this becomes problematic too.

#### Register an input binding
At the end of the input binding definition, we register it for Shiny.

```javascript
let myBinding = new Shiny.inputBinding();
  $.extend(myBinding, {
  // methods go here
});

Shiny.inputBindings.register(myBinding, 'reference');
```

Although the Shiny [documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/building-inputs.html) mentions a `Shiny.inputBindings.setPriority` method to handle conflicting bindings, this case almost never happens.

### Binding other elements
The Shiny input binding system is too convenient to be only used it for input elements. In {shinydashboard}, you may know the `box` function. Boxes are containers with a title, body, footer, as well as optional elements. It would be nice to capture the state of the box in an input, so as to trigger other actions as soon as this input changes. Since an input value is unique, we must add an `inputId` parameter to the box function. You may inspect the code [here](https://github.com/DivadNojnarg/outstanding-shiny-ui-code/blob/master/R/box2.R). 

Since we may collapse and uncollapse the box, we create the `updateBox2` function, which will toggle it:

```{r}
updateBox2 <- function(inputId, session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()) {
  session$sendInputMessage(inputId, message = NULL)
}
```

When collapsed, a box gets the `collapsed-box` class. Note: this will be useful for the input binding. As mentioned above, it is also necessary to know when to tell Shiny to update the value with the `subscribe` method. Most of the time, the change event might be sufficient, but as shinydashboard is built on top of [AdminLTE2](https://adminlte.io/docs/2.4/js-box-widget), it has an API to control the box behavior. We identify 2 events corresponding to the collapsible action: 
  
  - expanded.boxwidget (Triggered after the box is expanded)
  - collapsed.boxwidget (Triggered after the box is collapsed)
  
Unfortunately, after further investigations, those events are not possible to use since the AdminLTE code does not trigger them in the main JS [code](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard/blob/master/srcjs/AdminLTE/app.js) (see the collapse method line 577-612). There are other solutions, as shown below with the `click` event. 
  
There is also a plug and play `toggleBox` method. To unleash the power of our box, we need to activate it with `$('#<box_id>').activateBox();` before the binding step. If you remember, the `initialize` method is exactly doing this:

```javascript
let boxBinding = new Shiny.InputBinding();
$.extend(boxBinding, {
  initialize: function(el) {
    $(el).activateBox(); // box activation
  },
  find: function(scope) {
    return $(scope).find('.box');
  },
  getValue: function(el) {
    let isCollapsed = $(el).hasClass('collapsed-box')
    return {collapsed: isCollapsed}; // this will be a list in R
  },
  setValue: function(el, value) {
    $(el).toggleBox();
  }, 
  receiveMessage: function(el, data) {
    this.setValue(el, data);
    $(el).trigger('change');
  },
  subscribe: function(el, callback) {
    $(el).on('click', '[data-widget="collapse"]', function(event) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        callback();
      }, 550);
    }); 
    
    $(el).on('change', function(event) {
      setTimeout(function() {
        callback();
      }, 550);
    });
  },
  unsubscribe: function(el) {
    $(el).off('.boxBinding');
  }
});

Shiny.inputBindings.register(boxBinding, 'box-input');
```

Some comments about the binding:

  - `getValue` returns an object which will give a list in R. This is in case we add other elements like the remove action available in AdminLTE
  - `setValue` calls the plug and play `toggleBox` method
  - `receiveMessage` must trigger a change event so that Shiny knows when the value needs to be updated
  - `subscribe` listens to the `click` event on the `[data-widget="collapse"]` element and delays the `callback` call by a value which is slightly higher than the default AdminLTE2 animation to collapse the box (500mx). If you omit this part, the input will not have time to properly update!!!
  - We don't need an extra listener for the `updateBox2` function since it also triggers a click on the collapse button, thereby forwarding to the corresponding listener

Let's try our new toy in a simple dashboard:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  # import shinydashboard deps without the need of the dashboard template
  useShinydashboard(),

  tags$style("body { background-color: ghostwhite};"),

  br(),
  box2(
   title = textOutput("box_state"),
   "Box body",
   inputId = "mybox",
   collapsible = TRUE,
   plotOutput("plot")
  ),
  actionButton("toggle_box", "Toggle Box", class = "bg-success")
 )

 server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$plot <- renderPlot({
    req(!input$mybox$collapsed)
    plot(rnorm(200))
  })

  output$box_state <- renderText({
    state <- if (input$mybox$collapsed) "collapsed" else "uncollapsed"
    paste("My box is", state)
  })

  observeEvent(input$toggle_box, {
    updateBox2("mybox")
  })

 }

 shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Utilities to quickly define new inputs

### Introduction
If you ever wondered where the `Shiny.onInputChange` or `Shiny.setInputValue` comes from (see  [article](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/communicating-with-js.html)), it is actually defined in the `initShiny` function. 

```javascript
exports.setInputValue = exports.onInputChange = function(name, value, opts) {
  opts = addDefaultInputOpts(opts);
  inputs.setInput(name, value, opts);
};
```

Briefly, this function avoids creating an input binding. It is faster to code but there is a price to pay: losing the ability to easily update the new input. Indeed, all input functions like `sliderInput` have their own update function like `updateSliderInput`, because of the custom input binding system (We will see it very soon)!

### Examples
`Shiny.setInputValues` becomes powerful when combined to the numerous Shiny JavaScript events listed [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/js-events.html). This is what
we use in the [shinyMobile](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/articles/shinyMobile_tools.html) package to store the current device information in a shiny input.
Briefly, Framework7 (on top of which is built shinyMobile) has a method `Framework7.device`, which gives many [details](https://framework7.io/docs/device.html) related to the user device.

```javascript
$(document).on('shiny:connected', function(event) {
  Shiny.setInputValue('deviceInfo', Framework7.device);
});
```

This allows to conditionally display elements and deeply customize the interface.
In the example below, the card will not show on mobile devices. 

```{r, eval= FALSE}
library(shinyMobile)
shinyApp(
  ui = f7Page(
    title = "My app",
    f7SingleLayout(
      navbar = f7Navbar(
        title = "shinyMobile info",
        hairline = FALSE,
        shadow = TRUE
      ),
      # main content
      uiOutput("card"),
      verbatimTextOutput("info"),
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    
    output$info <- renderPrint(input$shinyInfo)

    # generate a card only for desktop
    output$card <- renderUI({
      if (!input$deviceInfo$desktop) {
        f7Card(
          "This is a simple card with plain text,
          but cards can also contain their own header,
          footer, list view, image, or any other element."
        )
      } else {
        f7Toast(
          session, 
          "You are on desktop! The card will not display", 
          position = "center"
        )
      }
    })
  }
)
```

### Custom data format
In some cases, the automatic Shiny R to JS data management may not meet our needs. For instance, assume we create a date in JS with `new Date()` and store it in a shiny input with `Shiny.setInputValue`. On the R side, we will not obtain a date but a character, which is not convenient. This is where input handlers are useful since they allow to manipulate data generated on the JS side before injecting them in R. Such handlers are created with `shiny::registerInputHandler` that takes 2 parameters:

  - type allows to connect the handler to `Shiny.setInputValue`. Note that the id is followed by the handler type, for instance `Shiny.setInputValue('test:handler', ...)` is connected to `shiny::registerInputHandler('handler', ...)`
  - a function to transform data, having data as main parameter
  
Below I exceptionally include JS code directly in the shiny app snippet, which is not best practice but convenient for the demonstration. Only the second input will give the correct result.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# You must click on the window to create inputs!!
registerInputHandler("textDate", function(data, ...) {
  if (is.null(data)) {
    NULL
  } else {
    res <- try(as.Date(unlist(data)), silent = TRUE)
    if ("try-error" %in% class(res)) {
      warning("Failed to parse dates!")
      # as.Date(NA)
      data
    } else {
      res
    }
  }
}, force = TRUE)

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "$(function(){
      $(window).on('click', function() {
        var currentTime = new Date();
        Shiny.setInputValue('time1', currentTime);
        Shiny.setInputValue('time2:textDate', currentTime);
      });
    });
    "
  ),
  verbatimTextOutput("res1"),
  verbatimTextOutput("res2")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$res1 <- renderPrint(list(class(input$time1), input$time1))
  output$res2 <- renderPrint(list(class(input$time2), input$time2))
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## Miscellaneous
We present some tools that may be useful...TO FINISH

### Get access to initial values 
Something we may notice when exploring the `initShiny` function is the existence of a `Shiny.shinyapp` object, defined as follows:

```javascript
var shinyapp = exports.shinyapp = new ShinyApp();
```


Let's explore what `shinyApp` contains. The definition is located in the shinyapps.js [script](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/shinyapp.js). 

```javascript
var ShinyApp = function() {
  this.$socket = null;
  
  // Cached input values
  this.$inputValues = {};
  
  // Input values at initialization (and reconnect)
  this.$initialInput = {};
  
  // Output bindings
  this.$bindings = {};
  
  // Cached values/errors
  this.$values = {};
  this.$errors = {};
  
  // Conditional bindings (show/hide element based on expression)
  this.$conditionals = {};
  
  this.$pendingMessages = [];
  this.$activeRequests = {};
  this.$nextRequestId = 0;
  
  this.$allowReconnect = false;
};
```

It creates several properties, some of them are easy to guess like `inputValues` or `initialInput`. Let's run the example below and open the HTML inspector. Notice that the `sliderInput` is set to 500 at `t0` (initialization).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
              min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```


Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-initial-inputs) shows how to access Shiny's initial input value with `Shiny.shinyapp.$initialInput.obs`. After changing the slider position, its value is given by `Shiny.shinyapp.$inputValues.obs`. `$initialInput` and `$inputValues` contains many more elements, however we are only interested in the slider function in this example.

```{r shiny-initial-inputs, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Explore initial input values'}
