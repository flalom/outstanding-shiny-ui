## HTML Tags

`{htmltools}` [@R-htmltools] contains tools to write HTML tags that were introduced in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
div()
```

If you had to gather multiple tags together, prefer `tagList()` as `list()`, although the HTML output is the same. The first has the shiny.tag.list class in addition to list. The `{golem}`  package [@R-golem] (see also http://golemverse.org) allows to test if an R object is a tag list. In this case, using a list would cause the test fail.

## Notations
Whether to use `tags$div` or `div` depends if the tag is exported by default.
For instance, you could use `htmltools::div` but not `htmltools::nav` since nav does not have a dedicated function (only for p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, a, br, div, span, pre, code, img, strong, em, hr). 
Rather use `htmltools::tags$nav`. Alternatively, there exists a function (in shiny and htmltools) 
called `withTags()`. Wrapping your code in this function enables you to use `withTags(nav(), ...)` instead of `tags$nav()`, thereby omitting the `tags$` prefixes.

## Adding new tags
The `tag` function allows to add extra HTML tags not already defined. You may use it as follows:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tag("test", list(class = "test", p("Custom Tag")))
# structure below
█─tag 
├─"test" 
└─█─list 
├─class = "test" 
└─█─p 
└─"Custom Tag" 
```

## Alternative way to write tags
htmltools comes with the `HTML()` function that you can feed with raw HTML:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
HTML('<div>Blabla</div>')
# will render exactly like
div("Blabla")

# but there class is different
class(HTML('<div>Blabla</div>'))
class(div("Blabla"))
```

You will not be able to use tag related functions, as in the following parts.
Therefore, I strongly recommand using R and not mixing HTML in R. Interestingly, if
you want to convert raw HTML to R code, there is a Shiny App developed by Alan
Dipert from RStudio, namely [html2R](https://github.com/alandipert/html2r). There
are some issues, non standard attributes (like `data-toggle`) are not correctly processed but there are [solutions](https://github.com/alandipert/html2r/issues/2). This will save you precious time!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://alandipert.shinyapps.io/html2r/", height = "600px")
```


## Playing with tags

### Tags structure

According to the `tag` function, a tag has:

- a name such as span, div, h1 ... `tag$name`
- some attributes, which you can access with `tag$attribs`
- children, which you can access with `tag$children`
- a class, namely "shiny.tag"

For instance:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create the tag
myTag <- div(
  class = "divclass", 
  id = "first",
  h1("Here comes your baby"),
  span(class = "child", id = "baby", "Crying")
)
# access its name
myTag$name
# access its attributes (id and class)
myTag$attribs
# access children (returns a list of 2 elements)
myTag$children
# access its class
class(myTag)
```

How to modify the class of the second child, namely span?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
second_children <- myTag$children[[2]]
second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag
# Hummm, this is not working ...
```

Why is this not working? By assigning `myTag$children[[2]]` to second_children, `second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"` modifies the class of the copy and not the original object. Thus we do:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
myTag$children[[2]]$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag
```

In the following section we explore helper functions, such as `tagAppendChild` from htmltools.


### Useful functions for tags

htmltools and Shiny have powerful functions to easily add attributes to tags, check for existing attributes, get attributes and add other siblings to a list of tags.

#### Add attributes

- `tagAppendAttributes`: this function allow you to add a new attribute to the current tag.

For instance, assuming you created a div for which you forgot to add an id attribute:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div("Where is my brain")
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, id = "here_it_is")
```

You can pass as many attributes as you want, including non standard attributes such as `data-toggle` (see Bootstrap 3 tabs for instance):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, `data-toggle` = "tabs")
# even though you could proceed as follows
mydiv$attribs[["aria-controls"]] <- "home"
```

#### Check if tag has specific attribute

- `tagHasAttribute`: to check if a tag has a specific attribute

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# I want to know if div has a class
mydiv <- div(class = "myclass")
has_class <- tagHasAttribute(mydiv, "class")
has_class
# if you are familiar with %>%
has_class <- mydiv %>% tagHasAttribute("class")
has_class
```

#### Get all attributes 

- `tagGetAttribute`: to get the value of the targeted attributes, if it exists, otherwise NULL.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "test")
# returns the class
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "class")
# returns NULL
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "id")
```

#### Set child/children

- `tagSetChildren` allows to create children for a given tag. For instance:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!")
# mydiv has 1 child "Not the mama!!!"
mydiv 
children <- lapply(1:3, span)
mydiv <- tagSetChildren(mydiv, children)
# mydiv has 3 children, the first one was removed
mydiv 
```

Notice that `tagSetChildren` removes all existing children. Below we see another set of functions to add children while conserving existing ones.

#### Add child or children

- `tagAppendChild` and `tagAppendChildren`: add other tags to an existing tag.
Whereas `tagAppendChild` only takes one tag, you can pass a list of tags to `tagAppendChildren`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!")
otherTag <- span("I am your child")
mydiv <- tagAppendChild(mydiv, otherTag)
```

You might wonder why there is no `tagRemoveChild` or `tagRemoveAttributes`.
Let's look at the `tagAppendChild`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tagAppendChild <- function (tag, child) {
  tag$children[[length(tag$children) + 1]] <- child
  tag
}
```

Below we write the `tagRemoveChild`, where tag is the target and n is the position to remove in the list of children:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!", span("Hey!"))

# we create the tagRemoveChild function
tagRemoveChild <- function(tag, n) {
  # check if the list is empty
  if (length(tag$children) == 0) {
    stop(paste(tag$name, "does not have any children!"))
  }
  tag$children[n] <- NULL
  tag
}
mydiv <- tagRemoveChild(mydiv, 1)
mydiv
```

When defining the `tagRemoveChild`, we choose `[` instead of `[[` to allow to select multiple list elements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!", "Hey!")
# fails
`[[`(mydiv$children, c(1, 2))
# works
`[`(mydiv$children, c(1, 2))
```

Alternatively, we could also create a `tagRemoveChildren` function. Also notice that the function raises an error if the provided tag does not have children. 

### Other interesting functions
The [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem/blob/dev/inst/utils/golem_utils_ui.R) package written by [thinkr](https://thinkr.fr) contains neat functions to edit your tags. 

Particularly, the `tagRemoveAttributes`:

```{r}
tagRemoveAttributes <- function(tag, ...) {
  attrs <- as.character(list(...))
  for (i in seq_along(attrs)) {
    tag$attribs[[ attrs[i] ]] <- NULL
  }
  tag
}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "test", id = "coucou", "Hello")
tagRemoveAttributes(mydiv, "class", "id")
```


### Conditionally set attributes

Sometimes, you only want to set attributes under specific conditions. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_button <- function(color = NULL) {
  tags$button( 
    style = paste("color:", color),
    p("Hello")
  )
}

my_button()
```

This example will not fail but having `style="color: "` is not clean. We may use conditions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_button <- function(color = NULL) {
  tags$button( 
    style = if (!is.null(color)) paste("color:", color),
    p("Hello")
  )
}

my_button("blue")
my_button()
```

In this example, style won't be available if color is not specified.

### Using %>%

While doing a lot of manipulation for a tag, if you don't need to create intermediate
objects, this is a good idea to use `%>%` from [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
div(class = "cl", h1("Hello")) %>% 
  tagAppendAttributes(id = "myid") %>%
  tagAppendChild(p("some extra text here!"))
```

The pipe syntax is overall easier to follow and read.

### Programmatically create children elements

Assume you want to create a tag with three children inside:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
div(
  span(1),
  span(2),
  span(3),
  span(4),
  span(5)
)
```

The structure is correct but imagine if you had to create 1000 `span` or fancier tag. The previous approach is not consistent with DRY programming. `lapply` function will be useful here (or the purrr `map` family):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# base R
div(lapply(1:5, function(i) span(i)))
# purrr + %>%
map(1:5, function(i) span(i)) %>% div()
```
