# htmltools overview {#htmltools-overview}

`{htmltools}` [@R-htmltools] is a R package designed to:

  - Generate HTML tags from R
  - Handle web dependencies (see chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies))

Historically, `{htmltools}` was extracted out of `{shiny}` [@R-shiny] to be able to extend it, that is developing custom HTML tags, importing extra dependencies from the web. That's why, both packages have many common functions! At the moment, `{htmltools}` does not have any user guide, although being a key package for all web things!

## Writing HTML Tags from R

`{htmltools}` provides the necessary functions to write HTML tags that were introduced in Chapter \@ref(web-intro-html). In R, it is even more convenient than raw HTML since their is no opening/closing tag, a simple function call instead:

```{r}
div()
```

does produce an HTML `<div></div>` tag. Inside the function call, all named elements will become `attributes`, whereas unnamed elements will become children. In some cases, tags may have empty attributes like `<input disabled>`. In that case,
the corresponding R code is `input(disabled = NA)`.

## Notations
Whether to use `tags$div` or `div` depends if the tag is exported by default.
For instance, you could use `htmltools::div` but not `htmltools::nav` since nav does not have a dedicated function (only for `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `a`, `br`, `div`, `span`, `pre`, `code`, `img`, `strong`, `em`, `hr`). 
Rather prefer `htmltools::tags$nav`. Alternatively, there exists a function (in shiny and htmltools) 
called `withTags`. Wrapping your code in this function allows code like this `withTags(nav(), ...)` instead of `tags$nav()`, thereby omitting the `tags$` prefixes. 
If you had to gather multiple tags together, choose `tagList()` over `list()`, although the HTML output is the same. The first has the `shiny.tag.list` class in addition to `list`. Package like `{golem}` [@R-golem] (see also http://golemverse.org) allows to test if an R object is a tag list. In this case, using a list would cause the test fail.

## Adding new tags
The `tag` function allows to add extra HTML tags not already defined. You may use it as follows:

```{r}
customTag <- tag("test", list(class = "test", p("Custom Tag")))
str(customTag)
customTag
```

Good practice is to check whether the created tag is in line with the HTML validation [rules](https://validator.w3.org/). 

## Alternative way to write tags
`{htmltools}` comes with the `HTML()` function that you can feed with raw HTML:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
HTML('<div>Blabla</div>')
# will render exactly like
div("Blabla")

# but there class is different
class(HTML('<div>Blabla</div>'))
class(div("Blabla"))
```

You will not be able to use tag related functions, as in the following parts.
Therefore, I strongly recommend using R and not mixing HTML in R. Interestingly, if
you want to convert raw HTML to R code, there is a Shiny App developed by Alan
Dipert from RStudio, namely [html2R](https://github.com/alandipert/html2r). There
are some issues, non standard attributes (like `data-toggle`) are not correctly processed but there are [solutions](https://github.com/alandipert/html2r/issues/2). This will save you precious time! A more recent approach is developed in section \@ref(workflow-charpente) and has be internally used to develop some of the RinteRface [templates](https://github.com/RinteRface).

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_app("https://alandipert.shinyapps.io/html2r/", height = "600px")
```


## Playing with tags

### Tags structure

A tag is defined by:

  - A name such as span, div, h1 ... `tag$name`
  - Some attributes, which can be accessed with `tag$attribs`
  - Children, which you can be accessed with `tag$children`
  - A class, namely `shiny.tag`

For instance:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create the tag
myTag <- div(
  class = "divclass", 
  id = "first",
  h1("Here comes your baby"),
  span(class = "child", id = "baby", "Crying")
)
# access its name
myTag$name
# access its attributes (id and class)
myTag$attribs
# access children (returns a list of 2 elements)
myTag$children
# access its class
class(myTag)
```

How to modify the class of the second child?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
second_children <- myTag$children[[2]]
second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag
# This is not working ...
```

Why is this not working? By assigning `myTag$children[[2]]` to second_children, `second_children$attribs$class <- "adult"` modifies the class of the copy and not the original object. Thus we do:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
myTag$children[[2]]$attribs$class <- "adult"
myTag
```

### Useful functions for tags

`{htmltools}` and `{shiny}` have powerful functions to seamlessly manipulate tags.

#### Add attributes

- `tagAppendAttributes`: this function allows to add a new attribute to the current tag.

For instance, assuming we created a div without any id attribute:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div("Where is my brain")
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, id = "here_it_is")
```

You can pass as many attributes as you want, including non standard attributes such as `data-toggle` (see Bootstrap 3 [tabs](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_js_collapse.asp) for instance):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- tagAppendAttributes(mydiv, list(`data-toggle` = "tabs", class = "myclass"))
# even though you could proceed as follows but this requires 2 steps
mydiv$attribs[["data-toggle"]] <- "tabs"
mydiv$attribs$class <- "myclass"
```

#### Check if tag has specific attribute

- `tagHasAttribute`: to check if a tag has a specific attribute

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# I want to know if div has a class
mydiv <- div(class = "myclass")
has_class <- tagHasAttribute(mydiv, "class")
has_class
# if you are familiar with %>%
has_class <- mydiv %>% tagHasAttribute("class")
has_class
```

In practice, this function is useful when testing tag elements as shown in chapter \@ref(custom-templates-testing).

#### Get all attributes 

- `tagGetAttribute`: to get the value of the targeted attributes, if it exists, otherwise NULL.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "test")
# returns the class
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "class")
# returns NULL
tagGetAttribute(mydiv, "id")
```

#### Set child/children

- `tagSetChildren` allows to create children for a given tag. For instance:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!")
# mydiv has 1 child "Not the mama!!!"
mydiv 
children <- lapply(1:3, span)
mydiv <- tagSetChildren(mydiv, children)
# mydiv has 3 children, the first one was removed
mydiv 
```

Notice that `tagSetChildren` removes all existing children. Below we see another set of functions to add children while conserving existing ones.

#### Add child or children

- `tagAppendChild` and `tagAppendChildren`: add other tags to an existing tag.
Whereas `tagAppendChild` only takes one tag, you can pass a list of tags to `tagAppendChildren`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!")
otherTag <- span("I am your child")
mydiv <- tagAppendChild(mydiv, otherTag)
```

#### Build your own functions

You might wonder why there is no `tagRemoveChild` or `tagRemoveAttributes`.
Let's look at the `tagAppendChild`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tagAppendChild <- function (tag, child) {
  tag$children[[length(tag$children) + 1]] <- child
  tag
}
```

Below we write the `tagRemoveChild`, where tag is the target and n is the position to remove in the list of children:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!", span("Hey!"))

# we create the tagRemoveChild function
tagRemoveChild <- function(tag, n) {
  # check if the list is empty
  if (length(tag$children) == 0) {
    stop(paste(tag$name, "does not have any children!"))
  }
  tag$children[n] <- NULL
  tag
}
mydiv <- tagRemoveChild(mydiv, 1)
mydiv
```

When defining the `tagRemoveChild`, we choose `[` instead of `[[` to allow to select multiple list elements:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "parent", id = "mother", "Not the mama!!!", "Hey!")
# fails
`[[`(mydiv$children, c(1, 2))
# works
`[`(mydiv$children, c(1, 2))
```

Alternatively, we could also create a `tagRemoveChildren` function. Also notice that the function raises an error if the provided tag does not have children. 

The `tagAppendChild` is not able to insert at a specific position. We could draft the `tagInsertChild` building on top of the base R `append` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tagInsertChild <- function(tag, child, position) {
  tag$children <- append(tag$children, list(child), position - 1)
  tag
}

tagInsertChild(p(span("hello")), a(), 1)
tagInsertChild(p(span("hello")), a(), 2)
```

### Other functions
The [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem/blob/dev/inst/utils/golem_utils_ui.R) package written by [thinkr](https://thinkr.fr) contains neat functions to edit your tags. 

Particularly, the `tagRemoveAttributes`:

```{r}
tagRemoveAttributes <- function(tag, ...) {
  attrs <- as.character(list(...))
  for (i in seq_along(attrs)) {
    tag$attribs[[ attrs[i] ]] <- NULL
  }
  tag
}
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mydiv <- div(class = "test", id = "coucou", "Hello")
tagRemoveAttributes(mydiv, "class", "id")
```


### Conditionally set attributes

Sometimes, you only want to set attributes under specific conditions. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_button <- function(color = NULL) {
  tags$button( 
    style = paste("color:", color),
    p("Hello")
  )
}

my_button()
```

This example will not fail but having `style="color: "` is not clean. We may use conditions:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_button <- function(color = NULL) {
  tags$button( 
    style = if (!is.null(color)) paste("color:", color),
    p("Hello")
  )
}

my_button("blue")
my_button()
```

In this example, style won't be available if color is not specified.

### Using %>%

While doing a lot of manipulation for a tag, if you don't need to create intermediate
objects, this is a good idea to use `%>%` from [magrittr](https://magrittr.tidyverse.org):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
div(class = "cl", h1("Hello")) %>% 
  tagAppendAttributes(id = "myid") %>%
  tagAppendChild(p("some extra text here!"))
```

The pipe syntax is overall easier to follow and read.

### Programmatically create children elements

Assume you want to create a tag with three children inside:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
div(
  span(1),
  span(2),
  span(3),
  span(4),
  span(5)
)
```

The structure is correct but imagine if you had to create 1000 `span` or fancier tag. The previous approach is not consistent with DRY programming. `lapply` function will be useful here (or the purrr `map` family):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# base R
div(lapply(1:5, function(i) span(i)))
# purrr + %>%
map(1:5, function(i) span(i)) %>% div()
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: tags structure (5 minutes)
Consider the following shiny tag:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
myTag <- a(
  class = "btn btn-large",
  type = "button",
  span(class = "child1", id = "super-span", 1),
  span(class = "child2", 2)
)

myTag
```

1. Inspect its structure. Hint: you may use `str`.
2. Access its class using `tagGetAttribute` and another method of your choice.
3. Modify the first child class to `custom class`.

### Exercise 2: modifiying tags (5 minutes)
Let us consider the following tag:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
temp <- div("Hello World")
```

(You may chain functions with `%>%`)

1. Replace its unique child by `a(href = "http://www.google.com", "click me!")`. Hint: `tagSetChildren` is your friend.
2. Add 10 other `span`. Hint: tags may be programmatically generated with `lapply` or `purrr::map`.
