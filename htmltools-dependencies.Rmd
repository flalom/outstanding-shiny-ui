# Dependency utilities {#htmltools-dependencies}
When creating a new template, you have to import custom HTML dependencies that are not available in shiny. Fortunately, this is not a problem with `{htmltools}` [@R-htmltools]!


## The dirty approach
Let's consider the following example. Since Bootstrap is one of the most popular HTML/CSS/JS framework to develop websites and web apps, we want to include a bootstrap 4 card in a shiny app. This case study is taken from a RStudio Community [question](https://community.rstudio.com/t/create-a-div-using-htmltools-withtags/22439/2). The naive approach would be to include the HTML code directly in the app code. This approach is dirty since it is not easily re-usable by others.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# we create the card function before
my_card <- function(...) {
  withTags(
    div(
      class = "card border-success mb-3",
      div(class = "card-header bg-transparent border-success"),
      div(
        class = "card-body text-success",
        h3(class = "card-title", "title"),
        p(class = "card-text", ...)
      ),
      div(class = "card-footer bg-transparent border-success", "footer")
    )
  )
}

# we build our app
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    fluidRow(
      column(
        width = 6,
        align = "center",
        br(),
        my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
      )
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {}
)
```

Nothing is displayed which was expected since `{shiny}` [@R-shiny] does not contain bootstrap 4 dependencies and this card is a bootstrap 4 element. Don't panic! We load the necessary css to display this card (if required, we could include the javascript as well). We could use either `includeCSS()`, `tags$head(tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", href = "custom.css"))`. See more [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/css.html). Web development best practice recommend to point to external file rather than including CSS in the head or directly on a tag (inline CSS). In the below example, we use a CDN (content delivery network) but that could be a local file located in the `www/` folder.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    # load the css code
    tags$head(
      tags$link(rel = "stylesheet", type = "text/css", href = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css")
    ),
    fluidRow(
      column(
        width = 6,
        align = "center",
        br(),
        my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
      )
    )
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {}
)
```

The card may seem ugly but at least it is displayed.

## The clean approach

The best approach consists in leveraging the `htmlDependency` and `attachDependencies` functions from `{htmltools}`.
The `htmlDependency` function takes the following main parameters:

- the dependency name
- the version (useful to remember on which version it is built upon)
- a path to the dependency (can be a CDN or a local folder)
- script and stylesheet to respectively pass css and scripts

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# handle dependency
card_css <- "bootstrap.min.css"
bs4_card_dep <- function() {
  htmlDependency(
    name = "bs4_card",
    version = "1.0",
    src = c(href = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/"),
    stylesheet = card_css
  )
}
```

If you are not pointing to a CDN and use local files, this is crucial to wrap the `htmlDependency` in a function since the path has to be determined at run time and not when the package builds. It means that if you are developing a package with dependencies, forgetting this step might prevent other users to get the dependency working on their own machine (the differences between Unix and Windows OS paths is clearly a good example).

We create the card tag and give it the bootstrap 4 dependency through the `attachDependencies()` function. In recent version of `{htmltools}`, we may simply use `tagList(tag, deps)` instead. Importantly, has an `append` parameter FALSE by default. Ensure to set it to TRUE if you want to keep already attached dependencies!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# create the card
my_card <- function(...) {
  cardTag <- withTags(
    div(
      class = "card border-success mb-3",
      div(class = "card-header bg-transparent border-success"),
      div(
        class = "card-body text-success",
        h3(class = "card-title", "title"),
        p(class = "card-text", ...)
      ),
      div(class = "card-footer bg-transparent border-success", "footer")
    )
  )
  
  # attach dependencies (old way)
  # htmltools::attachDependencies(cardTag, bs4_card_dep())
  
  # simpler way
  tagList(cardTag, bs4_card_dep())
  
}

```

We finally run our app:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# run shiny app 
ui <- fluidPage(
  title = "Hello Shiny!",
  fluidRow(
    column(
      width = 6,
      align = "center",
      br(),
      my_card("blablabla. PouetPouet Pouet.")
    )
  )
)

shinyApp(ui, server = function(input, output) { })
```

With this approach, you can develop a package of custom dependencies that people
could use when they need to add custom elements in shiny.


## Another example: Importing HTML dependencies from other packages

The `{shinydashboard}` [@R-shinydashboard] package helps to design dashboards with shiny. In the following, we would like to integrate the box component in a classic Shiny App (without the dashboard layout). However, if you try to include the box tag, you will notice that nothing is displayed since `{shiny}` does not have `{shinydashboard}` dependencies. `{htmltools}` contains a function, namely `findDependencies` that looks for all dependencies attached to a tag. Before going further, let's define the basic skeleton of a dashboard:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui = dashboardPage(
    dashboardHeader(),
    dashboardSidebar(),
    dashboardBody(),
    title = "Dashboard example"
  ),
  server = function(input, output) { }
)
```

There are numerous details associated with shinydashboard that we will not go into.  If you are interested in learning more, please [help yourself](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/). The key point here is the main wrapper function `dashboardPage`. The `fluidPage` is another wrapper function that most are already familiar with. We apply `findDependencies` on `dashboardPage`.

```{r}
deps <- findDependencies(
  dashboardPage(
    header = dashboardHeader(), 
    sidebar = dashboardSidebar(), 
    body = dashboardBody()
  )
)
deps
```

deps is a list containing four dependencies:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) handles icons. Interestingly, this dependency is provided by `dashboardHeader`, especially the `shiny::icon("bars")` that collapses the left sidebar
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) is the main HTML/CSS/JS template. Importantly,
please note the version 3.3.7, whereas the current is 4.5.2
- [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io) is the dependency containing HTML/CSS/JS related to the admin template.
It is closely linked to Bootstrap 3
- shinydashboard, the CSS and javascript necessary for our dashboard to work properly. In practice,
integrating custom HTML templates to shiny does not usually work out of the box for many reasons and some modifications are necessary. For instance, here is a list of [changes](https://github.com/rstudio/shinydashboard/blob/master/srcjs/AdminLTE/README-shiny-mods.md) to optimize adminLTE for shiny. This has major consequences on the template maintenance such that upgrading to another AdminLTE version would require to modify all these elements by hand. You may understand why template maintainers are quite often reluctant to upgrade their dependencies as it might brake the whole package, quite easily. 


Below, we attach the dependencies to the `box` with `tagList`, as shown above. Notice that our custom `box` does not contain all parameters as in the official `{shinydashboard}` version, which is actually ok at this time.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_box <- function(title, status) {
  tagList(box(title = title, status = status), deps)
}
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Shiny with a box"),
  my_box(title = "My box", status = "danger"),
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

You now have limitless possibilities!  Interestingly, this same approach is the basis of [shinyWidgets](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinyWidgets/blob/master/R/useBs4Dash.R) for the `useBs4Dash` function and other related tools.

## Suppress dependencies

In rare cases, you may need to remove an existing conflicting dependency. The `suppressDependencies` function allows users to perform this. For instance, [shiny.semantic](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.semantic) built on top of 
semantic ui is not compatible with Bootstrap. Below, we remove the AdminLTE dependency
from a `{shinydashboard}` page and nothing is displayed (as expected):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui = dashboardPage(
    dashboardHeader(),
    dashboardSidebar(),
    dashboardBody(suppressDependencies("AdminLTE")),
    title = "Dashboard example"
  ),
  server = function(input, output) { }
)
```

## Resolve dependencies
Imagine a situation in which we would like to use the very last version of fontawesome icons, that is currently 5.15.1 according to [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free). We recall that `{shiny}` already provides version 5.13.0 through the `icon` function. Including another version would probably cause conflicts and we would like to avoid that case. `{htmltools}` has a `resolveDependencies` tool that consists in removing any redundant element, taking the last version if dependencies names are identical. 

```{r}
new_icon_dep <- htmlDependency(
  name = "font-awesome", 
  version = "5.15.1", 
  src = c(href = "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fortawesome/fontawesome-free@5.15.1/"),
  stylesheet = "css/all.min.css"
)

icon_deps <- list(new_icon_dep, findDependencies(shiny::icon("th"))[[1]])

resolveDependencies(icon_deps)
```

Combining `findDependencies`, `suppressDependencies` and `resolveDependencies` gives you great power to successfully manage your dependencies!

## Insert Custom script in the head
With `{shinydashboardPlus}`, users can fine tune their dashboard behavior with a simple option parameter passed to `dashboardPagePlus`. The `sidebarExpandOnHover` capability that consists in expanding the sidebar when hovering on it is part of those [options](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html#adminlte-options), yet not exposed by `{shinydashboard}`. Under the hood, all those options are gathered in a (nested) list, then converted into JSON to eventually generate a JavaScript configuration file. Until now, we only saw two ways to include scripts or stylesheets. How do we include any arbitrary script (defined on the fly by the user when the app starts) in an dependency?

`htmlDependency` has a `head` parameter allowing to pass any lines of HTML to insert into the document head. We can easily imagine passing a string containing a script. Below, we first construct the options list. Then, we create the dependency: notice since `src` is mandatory, we have to give it a value but we will not use `script` nor `stylesheet` arguments.

```{r}

options <- list(
  sidebarExpandOnHover = TRUE, 
  boxWidgetSelectors = list(
    remove = '[data-widget="remove"]'
  )
)

config_script <- function() {
  htmlDependency(
    "options",
    as.character(utils::packageVersion("shinydashboardPlus")),
    src = c(file = system.file("shinydashboardPlus-0.6.0", package = "shinydashboardPlus")),
    head = if (!is.null(options)) {
      paste0(
        "<script>var AdminLTEOptions = ", 
        jsonlite::toJSON(
          options, 
          auto_unbox = TRUE,
          pretty = TRUE
        ),
        ";</script>"
      )
    }
  )
}

# show the script
print(HTML(config_script()$head))
```

I invite the reader to run the example below involving `{shinydashboardPlus}`, open the HTML inspector and look at the head. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
 shinyApp(
   ui = dashboardPagePlus(
     collapse_sidebar = TRUE,
     options = options,
     header = dashboardHeaderPlus(
      enable_rightsidebar = TRUE,
      rightSidebarIcon = "gears"
     ),
     sidebar = dashboardSidebar(),
     body = dashboardBody(),
     rightsidebar = rightSidebar(),
     title = "DashboardPage"
   ),
   server = function(input, output) { }
 )
```

According the the AdminLTE [documentation](https://adminlte.io/themes/AdminLTE/documentation/index.html#adminlte-options), global options must be passed before loading the app.min.js script. Creating this "dummy" dependency allowed us to isolate the script to insert it before the app.min.js script (contained in another [dependency](https://github.com/RinteRface/shinydashboardPlus/blob/master/R/deps.R#L43)), as shown on Figure \@ref(fig:htmltools-head-deps). 


```{r htmltools-head-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Insert arbitrary script in the head', out.width='100%'}
