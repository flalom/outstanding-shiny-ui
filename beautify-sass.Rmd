# Introduction to SASS {#beautify-sass}
One of the main problem with CSS is to handle the growing number of files and the code repetition. Nowadays, web developers mainly use [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/guide), which provides access to variables,  mathematical operators, nesting, thereby reducing the code complexity and extending the possibilities. [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com) developed the [{sass}](https://rstudio.github.io/sass/articles/sass.html) package, which makes it possible to use in Shiny apps or Rmarkdown documents.
