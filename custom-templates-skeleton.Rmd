# Template skeleton {#custom-templates-skeleton}
The list of all available layouts is quite impressive (horizontal, vertical, compressed, right to left, dark, ...). In the next steps, we will focus on the dark-compressed template. We leave the reader to try other templates as an exercise.

## Identify template elements
We are quite lucky since there is nothing fancy about the tabler layout. As usual, let's inspect the layout-condensed-dark.html (in the tabler /demo folder) in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-layout-intro)

```{r tabler-layout-intro, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler condensed layout'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-layout-intro.png")
```

There are 2 main components:
- the header containing the brand logo, the navigation and dropdown
- the content containing the dashboard body as well as the footer

<br>
<div class="callout callout-danger">
Something important: the dashboard body does not mean `<body>` tag!
</div>
<br>


This is all!


## Design the page layout

### The page wrapper

Do you remember the structure of a basic html page seen in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html)? Well, if not, here is a reminder.

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
  <head>
  <!-- head content here -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello World</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

We actually don't need to include the `<html>` tag since shiny will automatically do it. Below we construct a list of tags with `tagList`, including the head and the body. In the head we have the `meta` tags which has multiple purposes:

  - describe the encoding, 
  - how to display the app on different devices. For instance `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` is for iOS devices mobile support. 
  - Set the favicon, which is an icon representing the website icon, that is the one you may see on the right side of the searchbar. Try [twitter](https://twitter.com/home) for instance. 
  
The page title and favicon may be changed by the developer, so they may be included as parameters of the function. If you remember, there also should be CSS in the head but nothing here! Actually, the insertion of dependencies will be achieved by our `addDeps` function defined in Chapter \@ref(custom-templates-dependencies). Tabler comes with 2 main themes, namely white and dark, which may be applied through the `<body>` class attribute (respectively "antialiased theme-dark" and "antialiased"). The ... parameter contain other template elements like the header and the dashboard body, that remain to be created. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-dark) of Chapter \@ref(custom-templates-selection), the tabler dashboard template may contain a navigation bar and a footer. As they are not mandatory, we will not create dedicated parameters and pass all elements in the ...slot.

```{r}
tabler_page <- function(..., dark = TRUE, title = NULL, favicon = NULL){
  
  # head
  head_tag <- tags$head(
    tags$meta(charset = "utf-8"),
    tags$meta(
      name = "viewport", 
      content = "
        width=device-width, 
        initial-scale=1, 
        viewport-fit=cover"
    ),
    tags$meta(`http-equiv` = "X-UA-Compatible", content = "ie=edge"),
    tags$title(title),
    tags$link(
      rel = "preconnect", 
      href = "https://fonts.gstatic.com/", 
      crossorigin = NA
    ),
    tags$meta(name = "msapplication-TileColor", content = "#206bc4"),
    tags$meta(name = "theme-color", content = "#206bc4"),
    tags$meta(name = "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style", content = "black-translucent"),
    tags$meta(name = "apple-mobile-web-app-capable", content = "yes"),
    tags$meta(name = "mobile-web-app-capable", content = "yes"),
    tags$meta(name = "HandheldFriendly", content = "True"),
    tags$meta(name = "MobileOptimized", content = "320"),
    tags$meta(name = "robots", content = "noindex,nofollow,noarchive"),
    tags$link(rel = "icon", href = favicon, type = "image/x-icon"),
    tags$link(rel = "shortcut icon", href = favicon, type="image/x-icon")
  )
  
  # body
  body_tag <- tags$body(
    tags$div(
      class = paste0("antialiased ", if(dark) "theme-dark"),
      style = "display: block;",
      tags$div(class = "page", ...)
    )
  ) %>% add_tabler_deps()
  
  tagList(head_tag, body_tag)
}
```

Below we quickly test if a tabler element renders well which confirms our setup is adequate. To do this, we include a random tabler element taken from the demo html page, using `HTML`. Let's be clear: you should avoid as much as possible using `HTML` because of security [issues](https://mastering-shiny.org/advanced-ui.html). This also checks that our basic Shiny input/output system works as expected with a sliderInput linked to a plot output.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#thematic_on()
#onStop(thematic_off)
ui <- tabler_page(
  "test", 
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
              min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot"),
  br(),
  HTML(
    '<div class="col-sm-6 col-lg-3">
   <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
         <div class="d-flex align-items-center">
            <div class="subheader">Sales</div>
            <div class="ml-auto lh-1">
               <div class="dropdown">
                  <a class="dropdown-toggle text-muted" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
                  Last 7 days
                  </a>
                  <div class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right">
                     <a class="dropdown-item active" href="#">Last 7 days</a>
                     <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Last 30 days</a>
                     <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Last 3 months</a>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="h1 mb-3">75%</div>
         <div class="d-flex mb-2">
            <div>Conversion rate</div>
            <div class="ml-auto">
               <span class="text-green d-inline-flex align-items-center lh-1">

                     <polyline points="14 7 21 7 21 14"></polyline>
                  </svg>
               </span>
            </div>
         </div>
         <div class="progress progress-sm">
            <div class="progress-bar bg-blue" style="width: 75%" role="progressbar" aria-valuenow="75" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100">
               <span class="sr-only">75% Complete</span>
            </div>
         </div>
      </div>
   </div>
</div>
    '
  ),
title = "Tabler test"
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Ok, our info card and the shiny element work like a charm, which is a good start.  Now we may focus on the aesthetics.

### The body content
In this part, we translate the dashboard body HTML code to R. As a reminder, the [html2r](https://alandipert.shinyapps.io/html2r/) by [Alan Dipert](https://github.com/alandipert) substantially speeds up the conversion process. You copy the code in the HTML text area, click on convert and get the R shiny output. We create a function called `tabler_body`. The ... parameter holds all the dashboard body elements and the footer is dedicated for the future `tabler_footer` function.

```{r}
tabler_body <- function(..., footer = NULL) {
  div(
    class = "content",
    div(class = "container-xl", ...),
    tags$footer(class = "footer footer-transparent", footer)
  )
}
```

Let's test it with the previous example.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- tabler_page(tabler_body(h1("Hello World")))
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

Way better!


### The footer

The footer is composed of a left and right containers. We decide to create parameters left and right in which the user will be able to pass any elements. 

```{r}
tabler_footer <- function(left = NULL, right = NULL) {
  div(
    class = "container",
    div(
      class = "row text-center align-items-center flex-row-reverse",
      div(class = "col-lg-auto ml-lg-auto", right),
      div(class = "col-12 col-lg-auto mt-3 mt-lg-0", left)
    )
  )
}
```

All the class attributes are taken from the original HTML template. If you are already familiar with Bootstrap 4, you may easily customize the style. In short, `row` means that all elements will be aligned on a row, `text-center` amd `align-items-center` handle the text and content centering. `flex-row-reverse` display elements in a reversed order. Notice also that a `row` element contains columns created with the `col` class. The Bootstrap grid system relies on the Flexible Box Module, also known as [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox). 

As above, let's check our brand new element.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- tabler_page(
  tabler_body(
    p("Hello World"),
    footer = tabler_footer(
      left = "Rstats, 2020", 
      right = a(href = "https://www.google.com", "More")
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

### The navbar (or header)
This function is called `tabler_header`. In the Tabler template, the header has the `navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light` classes. We don't need the navbar-light class since we are only interested in the dark theme. As shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-header), the navbar is composed of 4 elements:

  - the navbar toggler is only visible when we reduce the screen width, like on mobile devices
  - the brand image
  - the navigation
  - the dropdown menus (this is not mandatory)
  
```{r tabler-header, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler header structure'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-header.png")
```

You may have a look at the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) documentation for extra configuration and layout.

Each of these element will be considered as an input parameter to the `tabler_navbar` function, except the navbar toggler which is a default element and must not be removed. Morever, we will only show the brand element when it is provided. The ... parameter is a slot for extra elements (between the menu and dropdowns). In the following, we start by creating the main container, that is `header_tag` and its unique child `container_tag`. The latter has 4 children `toggler_tag`, `brand_tag`, `dropdown_tag` and `navmenu_tag`. In this situations, {htmltools} functions like `tagAppendChild` and `tagAppendChildren` are game changers to better organize the code and make it more maintainable. One never knows in advance how much extra feature will be added to that component. Hence being cautious at the very beginning is crucial! 


```{r}
tabler_navbar <- function(..., brand_url = NULL, brand_image = NULL, nav_menu, nav_right = NULL) {
  
  header_tag <- tags$header(class = "navbar navbar-expand-md")
  container_tag <- tags$div(class = "container-xl")
  
  # toggler for small devices (must not be removed)
  toggler_tag <- tags$button(
    class = "navbar-toggler", 
    type = "button", 
    `data-toggle` = "collapse", 
    `data-target` = "#navbar-menu",
    span(class = "navbar-toggler-icon")
  )
  
  # brand elements
  brand_tag <- if (!is.null(brand_url) || !is.null(brand_image)) {
    a(
      href = if (!is.null(brand_url)) {
        brand_url
      } else {
        "#"
      },
      class = "navbar-brand navbar-brand-autodark d-none-navbar-horizontal pr-0 pr-md-3",
      if(!is.null(brand_image)) {
        img(
          src = brand_image, 
          alt = "brand Image",
          class = "navbar-brand-image"
        )
      }
    )
  }
  
  dropdown_tag <- if (!is.null(nav_right)) {
    div(class = "navbar-nav flex-row order-md-last", nav_right)
  }
  
  navmenu_tag <- div(
    class = "collapse navbar-collapse", 
    id = "navbar-menu",
    div(
      class = "d-flex flex-column flex-md-row flex-fill align-items-stretch align-items-md-center",
      nav_menu
    ),
    if (length(list(...)) > 0) {
      div(
        class = "ml-md-auto pl-md-4 py-2 py-md-0 mr-md-4 order-first order-md-last flex-grow-1 flex-md-grow-0", 
        ...
      )
    }
  )
  
  container_tag <- container_tag %>% tagAppendChildren(
    toggler_tag,
    brand_tag,
    dropdown_tag,
    navmenu_tag
  )
  
  header_tag %>% tagAppendChild(container_tag)
  
}
```

The navbar menu is the main component of the navbar. The ... parameter is a slot for the menu items. Compared to the original tabler dashboard template where there is only the class navbar-nav, we have to add at least, the `nav` class to make sure items are correctly activated/inactivated. The `nav-pills` class is to select pills instead of basic tabs (see [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/)), which is nothing more than a cosmetic consideration. Notice the `ul` tag that will contain `li` elements, that is the navbar items.

```{r}
tabler_navbar_menu <- function(...) {
  tags$ul(class = "nav nav-pills navbar-nav", ...)
}
```

Besides, each navbar menu item could be either a simple button or contain multiple menu sub-items. For now, we only focus on simple items.

#### Navbar navigation
The navbar is extremely important since it will drive the navigation of the template. We would like to associate each item to a separate page in the body content. This will allow us to go to a new page each time we change an item. In brief, it is very similar to the Shiny `tabsetPanel` function.

In HTML, menu items are `<a>` tags (links) with a given `href` attribute pointing to a specific page located in the server files. The point with a Shiny app is that we can't decide how to split our content into several pages. We only have app.R generating a simple HTML page. The strategy here is to create a tabbed navigation, to mimic multiple pages.

Let's see how tabset navigation works. In the menu list, all items must have: 

  - a `data-toggle` attribute set to tab 
  - an `href` attribute holding a unique id. This unique id is mandatory since it will point the menu item to the corresponding body content. 
  
On the body side, tab panels are contained in a tabset panel (simple div container), have a `role` attribute set to tabpanel and an `id` corresponding the `href` passed in the menu item. The exact match between `id` and `href` is mandatory, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-tabset). 

```{r tabler-tabset, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler tabset main principle'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-tabset.png")
```

Below, we propose a possible implementation of a menu item, as well as the corresponding body tab panel. The text parameter corresponds to the nav item text displayed in the menu. We also added an optional icon and the ability to select the item at start.

```{r}
tabler_navbar_menu_item <- function(text, tabName, icon = NULL, selected = FALSE) {
  
  item_cl <- paste0("nav-link", if(selected) " active")
  
  tags$li(
    class = "nav-item",
    a(
      class = item_cl,
      href = paste0("#", tabName),
      `data-toggle` = "pill", # see https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navs/
      `data-value` = tabName,
      role = "tab",
      span(class = "nav-link-icon d-md-none d-lg-inline-block", icon),
      span(class = "nav-link-title", text)
    )
  )
}
```

We also decided to add a fade transition effect between tabs, as per Bootstrap 4 documentation.

```{r}
tabler_tab_items <- function(...) {
  div(class = "tab-content", ...)
}

tabler_tab_item <- function(tabName = NULL, ...) {
  div(
    role = "tabpanel",
    class = "tab-pane fade container-fluid",
    id = tabName,
    ...
  )
}
```

What about testing this in a shiny app?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- tabler_page(
  tabler_navbar(
    brand_url = "https://preview-dev.tabler.io", 
    brand_image = "https://preview-dev.tabler.io/static/logo.svg", 
    nav_menu = tabler_navbar_menu(
      tabler_navbar_menu_item(
        text = "Tab 1",
        icon = NULL,
        tabName = "tab1",
        selected = TRUE
      ),
      tabler_navbar_menu_item(
        text = "Tab 2",
        icon = NULL,
        tabName = "tab2"
      )
    )
  ),
  tabler_body(
    tabler_tab_items(
      tabler_tab_item(
        tabName = "tab1",
        p("Hello World")
      ),
      tabler_tab_item(
        tabName = "tab2",
        p("Second Tab")
      )
    ),
    footer = tabler_footer(
      left = "Rstats, 2020", 
      right = a(href = "https://www.google.com")
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

At this point you might argue that we did not even validated the template elements. For instance, going back to the `tabler_navbar_menu_item` function, we find the following possible issues:

  - What happens if the user provides an invalid tabName, ie a text that is not valid for jQuery like `tab&?++`?
  - What happens if the user accidentally activates 2 tabs at start?
  
We will see later in Chapter \@ref(custom-templates-testing) how to validate those parameter.

#### Fine tune tabs behavior
Quite good isn't it? You will notice however that even if the first tab is selected by default, its content is not shown. To fix this, we will apply our jQuery skills. According to the Bootstrap documentation, we must trigger the show event on the active tab at start, as well as add the classes `show` and `active` to the associated tab panel in the dashboard body. We therefore target the nav item that has the active class and if no item is found, we select the first item by default and activate its body content.

```javascript
$(function() {
  // this makes sure to trigger the show event on the active   tab at start
  let activeTab = $('#navbar-menu .nav-link.active');
  // if multiple items are found
  if (activeTab.length > 0) {
    let tabId = $(activeTab).attr('data-value');
    $(activeTab).tab('show');
    $(`#${tabId}`).addClass('show active');
  } else {
    $('#navbar-menu .nav-link')
      .first()
      .tab('show');
  }
});
```

This script is included in the `www` folder of the below app. We'll see in Chapter \@ref(custom-templates-inputs) that custom input binding may perfectly handle this situation and are preferred.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#thematic_on()
#onStop(thematic_off)
# example with custom JS code to activate tabs
shinyAppDir(system.file("chapter12/tabler_tabs", package = "OSUICode"))
```

The result is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-nav).  I'd also suggest to include at least 1 input/output per tab, to test whether everything works properly. 

```{r tabler-nav, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler template with navbar'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-nav.png")
```


Looks like we are done for the main template elements. Actually, wouldn't it be better to include, at least, card containers?

### Card containers
Card are a central piece of template as they may contain visualizations, metrics and much more. Fortunately, Tabler has a large range of card containers. 


#### Classic card
What I call a classic card is like the `box` container of [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html). The card structure has key elements:

- a width to control the space taken by the card in the Bootstrap [grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/)
- a title, in general in the header (tabler does always not follow this rule and header is optional)
- a body where is the main content
- style elements like color statuses
- a footer (optional, tabler does not include this)

A comprehensive list of all tabler card features may be found [here](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/docs/cards.html). To be faster, I will copy the following HTML code in the [html2R](https://github.com/alandipert/html2r) shiny app to convert it to Shiny tags

```html
<div class="col-md-6">
  <div class="card">
    <div class="card-status-top bg-danger"></div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <h3 class="card-title">Title</h3>
      <p>Some Text.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Below is the result. The next step consist in replacing all content by parameters to the `tabler_card` function, whenever necessary. For instance, the first `<div>` sets the width of the card. The Bootstrap grid ranges from 0 to 12, so why not creating a width parameter to control the card size. We proceed similarly for the title, status, body content. It seems reasonable to allow title to be NULL (if so, the title will not be shown), same thing for the status. Regarding the card default width, a value of six also makes sense, which would take half of the row.

```{r}
tabler_card <- function(..., title = NULL, status = NULL, width = 6, padding = NULL) {
  
  card_cl <- paste0(
    "card", 
    if (!is.null(padding)) paste0(" card-", padding)
  )
  
  status_tag <- if (!is.null(status)) {
    div(class = paste0("card-status-top bg-", status))
  }
  
  body_tag <- div(
    class = "card-body",
    # we could have a smaller title like h4 or h5...
    if (!is.null(title)) {
      h3(class = "card-title", title)
    },
    ...
  )
  
  main_wrapper <- div(class = paste0("col-md-", width))
  card_wrapper <- div(class = card_cl)
  
  card_wrapper <- card_wrapper %>% tagAppendChildren(status_tag, body_tag)
  main_wrapper %>% tagAppendChild(card_wrapper)
}
```

In the meantime, I'd be also nice to be able to display cards in the same row. Let's create the `tabler_row`:

```{r}
tabler_row <- function(...) {
  div(class = "row row-deck", ...)
}
```

Below, we show an example of the `tabler_card` function, in combination with [apexcharter](https://github.com/dreamRs/apexcharter) by [dreamRs](https://www.dreamrs.fr).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# test the card
data("economics_long")
economics_long <- economics_long %>%
  group_by(variable) %>%
  slice((n()-100):n())

spark_data <- data.frame(
  date = Sys.Date() + 1:20,
  var1 = round(rnorm(20, 50, 10)),
  var2 = round(rnorm(20, 50, 10)),
  var3 = round(rnorm(20, 50, 10))
)

my_card <- tabler_card(
  apexchartOutput("my_chart"), 
  title = "My card", 
  status = "danger"
)

ui <- tabler_page(
  tabler_body(
    tabler_row(
      my_card,
      tabler_card(
        apexchartOutput("spark_box"), 
        title = "My card", 
        status = "success"
      ) 
    )
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {
  output$my_chart <- renderApexchart({
    apex(data = economics_long, type = "area", mapping = aes(x = date, y = value01, fill = variable)) %>%
      ax_yaxis(decimalsInFloat = 2) %>% # number of decimals to keep
      ax_chart(stacked = TRUE) %>%
      ax_yaxis(max = 4, tickAmount = 4)
  })
  
  output$spark_box <- renderApexchart({
    spark_box(
      data = spark_data[, c("date", "var3")],
      title = mean(spark_data$var3), 
      subtitle = "Variable 3",
      color = "#FFF", background = "#2E93fA",
      title_style = list(color = "#FFF"),
      subtitle_style = list(color = "#FFF")
    )
  })
}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

The code output is also shown in Figure \@ref(fig:tabler-card).

```{r tabler-card, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler card component'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-card.png")
```

### Ribbons: card components
Let's finish this part by including a card component, namely the [ribbon](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/docs/ribbons.html).

```{r}
tabler_ribbon <- function(..., position = NULL, color = NULL, bookmark = FALSE) {
  
  ribbon_cl <- paste0(
    "ribbon",
    if (!is.null(position)) sprintf(" bg-%s", position),
    if (!is.null(color)) sprintf(" bg-%s", color),
    if (bookmark) " ribbon-bookmark"
  )
  div(class = ribbon_cl, ...)
}
```

Integrating the freshly created ribbon component requires to modify the card structure since the ribbon is added after the body tag, and not parameter is associated with this slot. We could also modify the `tabler_card` function but htmltools contains tools to help us. Since the ribbon should be put after the card body (but in the card container), we may think about the `tagAppendChild` function, introduced in Chapter \@ref(htmltools-overview):

```{r}
# add the ribbon to a card
my_card <- tabler_card(title = "Ribbon", status = "info")

str(my_card)

my_card$children[[1]] <- my_card$children[[1]] %>% 
  tagAppendChild(
    tabler_ribbon(
      icon("info-circle", class = "fa-lg"), 
      bookmark = TRUE,
      color = "red"
    )
  )
```

As shown above, the ribbon has been successfuly included in the card tag. Now, we check how it looks in a shiny app.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- tabler_page(
  tabler_body(
    my_card
  )
)
server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

```{r tabler-ribbon, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Tabler ribbon component'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/practice/tabler-ribbon.png")
```

### Icons
Not mentionned before but we may include fontawesome icons provided with Shiny, as well as other libraries. Moreover, Tabler has a internal svg library located [here](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/icons.html).


## Exercises
1. Consider the tab card at the very bottom of the tabler [documentation](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/docs/cards.html). Propose an implementation of that feature.
2. Have a look at this [page](https://preview-dev.tabler.io/snippets.html). Select 2 elements and create the corresponding R functions.
