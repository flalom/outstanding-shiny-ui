["practice.html", "Chapter 3 Practice 3.1 Selecting a good template", " Chapter 3 Practice In this chapter, you will learn how to build your own html templates taken from the web and package them, so that they can be re-used at any time by anybody. 3.1 Selecting a good template There exists tons of HTML templates over the web. However, only a few part will be suitable for shiny, mainly because of what follows: shiny is built on top of bootstrap 3 (HTML, CSS and Javascript framework), meaning that going for another framework might not be straightforward. However, shinymaterial and shiny.semantic are examples showing this can be possible. shiny relies on jQuery (currently v 1.12.4 for shiny, whereas the latest version is 3.3.1). Consequently, all templates based upon React, Vue and other Javascript framework will not be natively supported. Again, there exist some examples for React with shiny and more generally, the reactR package developed by Kent Russell ((???) on Twitter) and Alan Dipert from RStudio. See the github repository for more details about all dependencies related to the shiny package. Therefore in the following, we will restict ourself to Bootstrap (3 and 4) together with jQuery. Don’t be disapointed since there is still a lot to say. Notes: As shiny depends on Bootstrap 3.3.7, we recommand the user who would like to experiment Boostrap 4 features to be particularly careful about potential incompatibilies. See a working example here with bs4Dash. A good source of open source HTML templates is Colorlib and Creative Tim. You might also buy your template, but forget about the packaging option, which would be illegal in this particular case, unless you have a legal agreement with the author (very unlikely however). "]
