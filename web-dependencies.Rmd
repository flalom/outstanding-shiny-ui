# Discover Shiny dependencies {#web-dependencies}

## Introduction
If Shiny creates HTML code for us, it is not enough to design a beautiful working app with user interactions. As shown earlier, all modern web sites and apps have a lot of CSS and JavaScript under the hood. Let's explore these elements in the following exercise.
  
The simplest Shiny layout is the `fluidPage`. The `shinyapp` predefined Rstudio snippet will create a basic app skeleton (type shinyapp in RStudio IDE):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  p("Hello World")
)

server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

At first glance, the page only contains text. Wait ... are you sure about this? Let's run the above example and open the HTML inspector introduced in \@ref(web-intro-html). Results are displayed on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deps).

```{r shiny-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny dependencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-deps.png")
```

  1. Click on "Open in Browser"
  2. Open the HTML inspector
  3. Locate the `<head>` tag 
  4. Uncollapse it and search for the script containing   `application/html-dependencies`
  5. List all dependencies

We see in the head section (delimited by `<head></head>`) that Shiny has four dependencies:

  - json2
  - jQuery 3.4.1
  - shiny (custom JavaScript and CSS)
  - Bootstrap 3.4.1 (JavaScript and CSS) + other files (html5shiv, respond)

## Bootstrap
According to the gitstar ranking, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) comes at the 7th place (144563 stars) and 22th place for repositories and organization, respectively. It has been first released in 2011 and will welcome the fifth [version](https://v5.getbootstrap.com/) in few months. It provides plug and play layout and interactive elements such as tabs, navigation bars, tooltips, popovers and many input (forms), which is rather convenient since it avoids writing a large amount of CSS/JavaScript that would bring more complexity. The first release of Shiny was shipped with [Bootstrap 2](https://github.com/rstudio/shinybootstrap2). Shiny currently relies on Bootstrap 3 since v0.11, while a lot of efforts are being made to provide a Bootstrap 4 compatibility, essentially through the [bootstraplib](https://github.com/rstudio/bootstraplib) R package. 

One of the great advantage of using Bootstrap is the responsiveness of the design that can work either on desktop or mobile, even though advanced user likely prefer other specialized libraries like [Framework7](https://framework7.io/) or [onsenUI](https://onsen.io/) to develop native looking apps.

Bootstrap 3 relies on the grid layout [system](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/examples/grid/) that allows to efficiently organize the content in row and columns. For instance the `fluidRow` and `column` Shiny functions leverage the Bootstrap grid to control how elements are displayed in a page.


## jQuery, DOM manipulation
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) allows to perform DOM manipulation, that is interacting with HMTL elements, in a more user-friendly manner than with pure JavaScript. At that step, you might not be familiar with JavaScript nor jQuery. Don't worry chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript) will expose the basics. Below is a comparison on how you would select a button HTML element with both technologies. I am sure you'll notice how jQuery[^jQuery] is more intuitive than JavaScript.

Javascript:
```js
var btn = document.getElementById('mybutton'); // select the button
btn.addEventListener('click', function() { // action + consequences
  alert('You clicked me!'); // action
});
```

jQuery:

```js
$('#mybutton').on('click', function() {
  alert('You clicked me!');
});
```

[^jQuery]: The next iteration of Bootstrap, namely [Bootstrap 5](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/) completely abandons jQuery for vanilla JavaScript. The main reason is to lighten the Bootstrap code. 


## Data formating
json2 is a library to handle the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data format (JavaScript Object Notation). We will see in section \@ref(shiny-websocket) of Chapter \@ref(shiny-intro) that the R / JS communication involves data exchange and given that data structures are not the same in R and JS, there must be a way to ensure the translation. This is done through the [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package that allows to transform JSON objects in R objects with `jsonlite::fromJSON` and inversely with `jsonlite::toJSON`. Shiny automatically handles the process and it works well most of the time!

## Custom dependencies
The last dependency contains custom JS and CSS code necessary for Shiny to work, that is:

  - Fine tuning the layout
  - Registering input/output
  - Handling every single input/output action
  - Initializing and controlling the R/JS communication
  - Handling alerts/modals/notifications
  - ...

Part \@ref(shiny-js-object), \@ref(shiny-input-system), \@ref(shiny-custom-handler) and \@ref(custom-templates-interactivity) showcase the most important elements of those custom files.

## Exercise

In the following exercise, we consider a more complex app with a slider as well as a plot output.

  1. Run the app `runExample("01_hello")`
  2. Open the HTML inspector
  3. Delete the bootstrap.min.css and ion.rangeSlider.css
  4. Conclusions
  
  
To sump up, all these libraries are necessary to make Shiny what it is! 
  
In Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies), we explore tools to manage HTML dependencies. In Chapter \@ref(insert-tabs), we study a special case to insert dependencies during the app runtime.  

Let's move to the next part to discover the internal engine that creates HTML code from R!
