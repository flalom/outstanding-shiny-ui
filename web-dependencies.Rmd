# Discover Shiny dependencies {#web-dependencies}
We are now convinced that Shiny creates HTML code for us. Is it enough to design a beautiful working app with user interactions? For sure no! As shown above, we also need CSS and JavaScript. Let's explore these elements in the following exercise.
  
  1. The simplest Shiny layout is the `fluidPage`. The `shinyapp` predefined Rstudio snippet will create a basic app skeleton (type shinyapp in RStudio IDE):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  p("Hello World")
)

server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

At first glance, the page only contains text. Wait ... are you sure about this? Let's run the above example and open the HTML inspector introduced in \@ref(web-intro-html). Results are displayed on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deps).

```{r shiny-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny dependencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-deps.png")
```


  2. Click on "Open in Browser".
  3. Open the HTML inspector.
  4. Locate the `<head>` tag. 
  
  5. Uncollapse it and search for the script containing   `application/html-dependencies`.

We see in the head section, delimited by `<head></head>`, that Shiny has four dependencies:

  - json2
  - jQuery 3.4.1
  - shiny (custom JavaScript and CSS)
  - Bootstrap 3.4.1 (JavaScript and CSS) + other files (html5shiv, respond)

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is here to provide plug and play design and interactions (tabs, navigation bars, tooltips, popovers, ...). For instance the `fluidRow` and `column` functions of Shiny leverage the Bootstrap grid to control how elements are displayed in a page. This is convenient because it avoids writing a large amount of CSS/JavaScript that essentially juts reinvents the wheel. 

As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript), jQuery allows to perform DOM manipulation, that is interacting with HMTL elements, in a more user-friendly manner than with pure JavaScript.

Shiny has its own JS and CSS files. We will discuss some of them later in this section.

Finally, json2 is a library to handle the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data format (JavaScript Object Notation). The R / JS communication involves data exchange and given that data structures are not the same in R and JS, there must be a way to ensure the translation. This is done through the [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package that allows to transform JSON objects in R objects with `jsonlite::fromJSON` and inversely with `jsonlite::toJSON`. Fortunately Shiny automatically handles the process and it works well most of the time!
  
  6. Try to delete the bootstrap.min.css and ion.rangeSlider.css.
  7. Conclusions.
  
  
In summary, all these libraries are necessary to make Shiny what it is! 
  
In Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies) we will explore tools to manage HTML dependencies. In Chapter \@ref(insert-tabs), we will see a special case to insert dependencies during the app runtime  

Let's move to the next part to discover how Shiny creates HTML code from R!
