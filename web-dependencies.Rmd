# Discover Shiny dependencies {#web-dependencies}

## Introduction
If Shiny creates HTML code for us, it is not enough to design a beautiful working app with user interactions? As shown above, Shiny also need CSS and JavaScript. Let's explore these elements in the following exercise.
  
The simplest Shiny layout is the `fluidPage`. The `shinyapp` predefined Rstudio snippet will create a basic app skeleton (type shinyapp in RStudio IDE):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  p("Hello World")
)

server <- function(input, output) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

At first glance, the page only contains text. Wait ... are you sure about this? Let's run the above example and open the HTML inspector introduced in \@ref(web-intro-html). Results are displayed on Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deps).

```{r shiny-deps, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny dependencies'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-deps.png")
```

  1. Click on "Open in Browser"
  2. Open the HTML inspector
  3. Locate the `<head>` tag 
  4. Uncollapse it and search for the script containing   `application/html-dependencies`
  5. List all dependencies

We see in the head section, delimited by `<head></head>`, that Shiny has four dependencies:

  - json2
  - jQuery 3.4.1
  - shiny (custom JavaScript and CSS)
  - Bootstrap 3.4.1 (JavaScript and CSS) + other files (html5shiv, respond)

## Bootstrap 3
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) is here to provide plug and play design and interactions (tabs, navigation bars, tooltips, popovers, ...). For instance the `fluidRow` and `column` functions of Shiny leverage the Bootstrap grid to control how elements are displayed in a page. This is convenient because it avoids writing a large amount of CSS/JavaScript that essentially juts reinvents the wheel.

In addition, Shiny has its own JS and CSS files. We will discuss some of them later in this section.

## jQuery, DOM manipulation
As mentioned in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) allows to perform DOM manipulation, that is interacting with HMTL elements, in a more user-friendly manner than with pure JavaScript. Interestingly, the next iteration of Bootstrap, namely [Bootstrap 5](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2020/06/16/bootstrap-5-alpha/) completely abandoned jQuery for vanilla JavaScript.


## Data formating
json2 is a library to handle the [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) data format (JavaScript Object Notation). We will see in section \@ref(shiny-websocket) of Chapter \@ref(shiny-intro) that the R / JS communication involves data exchange and given that data structures are not the same in R and JS, there must be a way to ensure the translation. This is done through the [jsonlite](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) package that allows to transform JSON objects in R objects with `jsonlite::fromJSON` and inversely with `jsonlite::toJSON`. Fortunately Shiny automatically handles the process and it works well most of the time!
  
  
## Exercise

In the following exercise, we consider a more complex app with a slider as well as a plot output.

  1. Run the app `runExample("01_hello")`.
  2.Open the HTML inspector.
  3. Delete the bootstrap.min.css and ion.rangeSlider.css.
  4. Conclusions.
  
  
To sump up, all these libraries are necessary to make Shiny what it is! 
  
In Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies) we will explore tools to manage HTML dependencies. In Chapter \@ref(insert-tabs), we will see a special case to insert dependencies during the app runtime.  

Let's move to the next part to discover the internal engine that creates HTML code from R!
