# Introduction {#shiny-intro}

## Shiny, HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
In the book prerequisites, to get the most out of this book, it was recommended that the reader should be quite familiar with Shiny. In the two previous chapters, we quickly introduced HTML and JavaScript. However, in this chapter, we are going to see what Shiny has under the hood.

Shiny allows the development of web applications with R in minutes. Let's face it: this is quite mind blowing! While this may not be a production ready app, it will still be a fully functional, working prototype. Believe me, doing a web application with pure HTML/CSS and JavaScript is more difficult, especially for someone with a non-web developer background. 

Is Shiny less customizable than a classic web app? Not at all! Indeed, Shiny has its own engine to build HTML tags, through R, meaning that all HTML elements are available. You may also include any custom [JavaScript](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/packaging-javascript.html) or [CSS](https://mastering-shiny.org/advanced-ui.html) code. 

Do you remember about the first exercise in Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-html)?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
p("Hello World")
```

The `p` function generates HTML (see chapter \@ref(htmltools-overview)). The main difference between HTML tags and Shiny tags is the absence of closing tag for Shiny. For instance, in raw HTML, we expect `<p>` to be closed by `</p>`. In Shiny, we only call `p(...)`, where `...` may be attributes like class/id or children tags.

In this chapter, we will answer to the following questions:

- What web dependencies is Shiny based on?
- How is R/JavaScript communication achieved?
- How does Shiny deal with inputs? 


In Chapter \@ref(htmltools-dependencies) we will explore tools to manage HTML dependencies. In Chapter \@ref(insert-tabs), we will see a special case to insert dependencies during the app runtime. Finally, in the last part of this book, we will be designing custom inputs and knowing how to debug them is priceless.

## Websocket: R/JS bidirectional communication {#shiny-websocket}
How does R (server) and JavaScript (client) communicate? This is a built-in Shiny feature highlighted [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny), which leverages the [httpuv](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv) and [websocket](https://github.com/rstudio/websocket) packages. Before going further let's define what is a websocket! It is an advanced technology allowing bidirectional communication between a client and a server. For instance, a chat system may be built on top of a websocket. In the following, we will show how to inspect the websocket in a web browser. Let's run the following app (see  \@ref(fig:shiny-websocket), left panel)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("variable", "Variable:",
                c("Cylinders" = "cyl",
                  "Transmission" = "am",
                  "Gears" = "gear")),
    tableOutput("data")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$data <- renderTable({
      mtcars[, c("mpg", input$variable), drop = FALSE]
    }, rownames = TRUE)
  }
)
```

After opening the HTML inspector, we select the network tab and search for websocket in the list. By choosing the message tab, you may inspect what R and JavaScript say to each others. On the JavaScript side, the websocket is created in the shinyapp.js [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/shinyapp.js). The first element received from R is the first message in the list shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-websocket). It is a JSON object containing the method used as well as passed data. In the meantime, you may change the select input value.

```javascript
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
  method: 'init',
  data: self.$initialInput
}));
```

The second message received from R is after updating the select input.

```javascript
this.sendInput = function(values) {
  var msg = JSON.stringify({
    method: 'update',
    data: values
  });
// other things
};
```

Although complex, it is extremely useful to check whether the input / output communication are working properly. If not, we would see the error field identifying the issue. 

Finally, `Shiny.shinyapp.$socket.readyState` returns the state of the socket connection. It should be 1 if your app is running. In some instances when the socket is closed, nothing would be shown. Note that the R option `options(shiny.trace = TRUE)` allows the websocket messages to be displayed directly in the R console.


```{r shiny-websocket, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny websocket'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-websocket.png")
```

## The Shiny session object {#shiny-session}
We won't be able to go anywhere without giving some reminders about the Shiny [session](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.4.0/session.html) object. Why do we say object? `session` is actually an instance of the [`ShinySession`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/R/shiny.R) R6 class. 
The initialization takes one parameter, namely the websocket. As shown in the last section, the websocket allows bidirectional exchanges between R and JS. Understanding how R and JS communicate allows us to discuss the Shiny input system.

  - `sendCustomMessage` sends messages from R to JS. It calls the private `sendMessage` method which itself calls `write`. The message is sent only when the session is opened, throught the websocket `private$websocket$send(json)`. If the `shiny.trace` [option](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/0.14/shiny-options.html) is TRUE, a message showing the sent JSON is displayed, which is useful for debugging.
  - `sendInputMessage` is used to update inputs from the server
  
The below code is extracted from the `shiny.R` [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/R/shiny.R).

```{r}
sendCustomMessage = function(type, message) {
  data <- list()
  data[[type]] <- message
  private$sendMessage(custom = data)
}

sendInputMessage = function(inputId, message) {
  data <- list(id = inputId, message = message)
  
  # Add to input message queue
  private$inputMessageQueue[[length(private$inputMessageQueue) + 1]] <- data
  # Needed so that Shiny knows to actually flush the input message queue
  self$requestFlush()
}


sendMessage = function(...) {
  # This function is a wrapper for $write
  msg <- list(...)
  if (anyUnnamed(msg)) {
    stop("All arguments to sendMessage must be named.")
  }
  private$write(toJSON(msg))
}


write = function(json) {
  if (self$closed){
    return()
  }
  traceOption <- getOption('shiny.trace', FALSE)
  if (isTRUE(traceOption) || traceOption == "send")
    message('SEND ',
            gsub('(?m)base64,[a-zA-Z0-9+/=]+','[base64 data]',json,perl=TRUE))
  private$websocket$send(json)
}
# ...
```

No worry if it is not clear at the moment. We will discuss those elements in the following sections.
