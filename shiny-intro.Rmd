# Introduction {#shiny-intro}

In this chapter, we will answer to the following questions:

- How is R/JavaScript communication achieved?
- How does Shiny deal with inputs? 


In the last part of this book, we will be designing custom inputs and knowing how to debug them is priceless.

## Websocket: R/JS bidirectional communication {#shiny-websocket}
How does R (server) and JavaScript (client) communicate? This is a built-in Shiny feature highlighted [here](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny), which leverages the [httpuv](https://github.com/rstudio/httpuv) and [websocket](https://github.com/rstudio/websocket) packages. Before going further let's define what is a websocket! It is an advanced technology allowing bidirectional communication between a client and a server. For instance, a chat system may be built on top of a websocket. In the following, we will show how to inspect the websocket in a web browser. Let's run the following app (see  \@ref(fig:shiny-websocket), left panel)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("variable", "Variable:",
                c("Cylinders" = "cyl",
                  "Transmission" = "am",
                  "Gears" = "gear")),
    tableOutput("data")
  ),
  server = function(input, output) {
    output$data <- renderTable({
      mtcars[, c("mpg", input$variable), drop = FALSE]
    }, rownames = TRUE)
  }
)
```

After opening the HTML inspector, we select the network tab and search for websocket in the list. By choosing the message tab, you may inspect what R and JavaScript say to each others. On the JavaScript side, the websocket is created in the shinyapp.js [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/srcjs/shinyapp.js). The first element received from R is the first message in the list shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-websocket). It is a JSON object containing the method used as well as passed data. In the meantime, you may change the select input value.

```javascript
socket.send(JSON.stringify({
  method: 'init',
  data: self.$initialInput
}));
```

The second message received from R is after updating the select input.

```javascript
this.sendInput = function(values) {
  var msg = JSON.stringify({
    method: 'update',
    data: values
  });
// other things
};
```

Although complex, it is extremely useful to check whether the input / output communication are working properly. If not, we would see the error field identifying the issue. 

Finally, `Shiny.shinyapp.$socket.readyState` returns the state of the socket connection. It should be 1 if your app is running. In some instances when the socket is closed, an error would be raised. Note that the R option `options(shiny.trace = TRUE)` allows the websocket messages to be displayed directly in the R console.


```{r shiny-websocket, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Shiny websocket'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-websocket.png")
```
We see below that we can even bypass the UI element and update the input value directly via the websocket using `Shiny.shinyapp.$sendMsg` with the `update` method.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
updateObsVal <- function(value) {
  sprintf(
    "Shiny.shinyapp.$sendMsg(JSON.stringify({
      method: 'update',
      data: {obs: %s}
    }));",
    value
  )
}

# below we shunt the slider input by sending message
# directly through the websocket

ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$button(
    "Update obs value",
    onclick = updateObsVal(4)
  ),
  sliderInput("obs", "Number of observations:",
              min = 0, max = 1000, value = 500
  ),
  plotOutput("distPlot")
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  output$distPlot <- renderPlot({
    hist(rnorm(input$obs))
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```


## The Shiny session object {#shiny-session}
We won't be able to go anywhere without giving some reminders about the Shiny [session](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/1.4.0/session.html) object. Why do we say object? `session` is actually an instance of the [`ShinySession`](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/R/shiny.R) R6 class. 
The initialization takes one parameter, namely the websocket. As shown in the last section, the websocket allows bidirectional exchanges between R and JS. Understanding how R and JS communicate allows us to discuss the Shiny input system.

  - `sendCustomMessage` sends messages from R to JS. It calls the private `sendMessage` method which itself calls `write`. The message is sent only when the session is opened, throught the websocket `private$websocket$send(json)`. If the `shiny.trace` [option](https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/0.14/shiny-options.html) is TRUE, a message showing the sent JSON is displayed, which is useful for debugging.
  - `sendInputMessage` is used to update inputs from the server
  
The below code is extracted from the `shiny.R` [file](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/blob/master/R/shiny.R).

```{r}
sendCustomMessage = function(type, message) {
  data <- list()
  data[[type]] <- message
  private$sendMessage(custom = data)
}

sendInputMessage = function(inputId, message) {
  data <- list(id = inputId, message = message)
  
  # Add to input message queue
  private$inputMessageQueue[[length(private$inputMessageQueue) + 1]] <- data
  # Needed so that Shiny knows to actually flush the input message queue
  self$requestFlush()
}


sendMessage = function(...) {
  # This function is a wrapper for $write
  msg <- list(...)
  if (anyUnnamed(msg)) {
    stop("All arguments to sendMessage must be named.")
  }
  private$write(toJSON(msg))
}


write = function(json) {
  if (self$closed){
    return()
  }
  traceOption <- getOption('shiny.trace', FALSE)
  if (isTRUE(traceOption) || traceOption == "send")
    message('SEND ',
            gsub('(?m)base64,[a-zA-Z0-9+/=]+','[base64 data]',json,perl=TRUE))
  private$websocket$send(json)
}
# ...
```

No worry if it is not clear at the moment. We will discuss those elements in the following sections.


## The Shiny JavaScript object {#shiny-js-object}
The `Shiny` object is exported at the top of the `shiny.js` file [^export-js]. In other words, this means that we may use this object and any of its properties within the HTML inspector console tab, in any JavaScript file or shiny app as below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ui <- fluidPage(
  tags$script(
    "$(function() {
      console.log(Shiny);
    });
    "
  )
)
server <- function(input, output, session) {}
shinyApp(ui, server)
```

This object contains many properties and methods as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-object). Some of particular interest, such as like `Shiny.setInputValue`, `Shiny.addCustomMessageHandler`, `Shiny.shinyapps`, `Shiny.bindAll`, ... will be detailed later

```{r shiny-object, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The Shiny JavaScript object'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/survival-kit/shiny-object.png")
```

[^export-js]: Refer to Chapter \@ref(survival-kit-javascript) if you don't remember how to export an object and make it available to all JS files.
