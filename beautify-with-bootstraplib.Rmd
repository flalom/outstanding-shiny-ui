# Beautify with bootstraplib {#beautify-with-bootstraplib}
`{bootstraplib}` [@R-bootstraplib] is a package developed by RStudio. It is built on top `{sass}` like `{fresh}` [@R-fresh]. 

## Plug and play customization
Like `{fresh}`, `{bootstraplib}` offers a high level set of functions allowing to quickly customize shiny apps. For many users, this step will be enough. `bs_theme` allows to seamlessly modify the main CSS properties like:

  - The background color.
  - The foreground color.
  - Change default theme colors, also called [accents](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
  - Modify the font.
  
Additionally, it gives the flexibility to choose Bootstrap version with `version_default`. As shown in Chapter \@ref(web-dependencies), Shiny primarily relies on Bootstrap 3. This function has 3 flavors:

  - Bootstrap 3, with `"3"`.
  - Bootstrap 4, with `"4"`.
  - Bootstrap 4 + compatibility with Bootstrap 3, with `"4+3"`.
  
Advanced users appreciate a `...` slot to add extra variables through `bs_add_variables`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bootstraplib)

bs_theme(
  version = version_default(),
  bootswatch = NULL,
  ...,
  bg = NULL,
  fg = NULL,
  primary = NULL,
  secondary = NULL,
  success = NULL,
  info = NULL,
  warning = NULL,
  danger = NULL,
  base_font = NULL,
  code_font = NULL,
  heading_font = NULL
)
```

`bs_update_theme` is able to update a give theme object, generated with `bs_theme`.

At any time, developers may preview to resulting theme with `bs_theme_preview`, passing the newly created theme as main parameter. For instance:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(shiny)
material <- bs_theme(
  bg = "#000000", 
  fg = "#FFFFFF", 
  primary = "#9600FF", 
  secondary = "#1900A0",
  success = "#38FF12",
  info = "#00F5FB",
  warning = "#FFF100",
  danger = "#FF00E3",
  base_font = "Marker Felt",
  heading_font = "Marker Felt",
  code_font = "Chalkduster"
)
bs_theme_preview(material, with_themer = FALSE)
```

This gives the result shown in Figure \@ref(fig:bootstraplib-theme-preview).

```{r bootstraplib-theme-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='bs_theme_preview feature in action', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/beautify/bootstraplib-theme-preview.png")
```

Passing `with_themer = TRUE` will show a live theming tools to modify the current theme.
